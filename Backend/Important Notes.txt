1. create new nodejs project
   npm init -y
   install dependies 
         --> Express
         --> Mongoose
         --> dot env
         --> jsonswebtoken 
         --> bcryptjs
         --> cookies-parser
         --> cloudinary
         --> socketio
         --> nodemon -D  (dev dependies)


2. Token generation 
       --> using salt and hash
       --> when token is generated the token is sent in cookies
       --> token expires in 7 days 
       --> using inbiilt function bcryptjs 

3. login 
      --> using email & password
      --> generate token and return the user info

4. signup
      --> fullname email & password

5. logout
      --> using jwt token maxAge      

6. update
      --> update profilepic use put method
      --> first check whether the user is loged in or not using protectRoute
      --> in protect Route check token if token is present then decode it.
      --> token decode(token,and jwt secrect key).
      --> token uses cookie-parser (inbuilt function) to parser jwt 
      --> login into cloudinary & then configure it in lib
      --> when update function is called  first it is uploaded to cloudinary  using uploadresponse then 
      --> using uploadresponse  it gives the secured_url
      --> using that url we will update the profile profilepic

7.check 
      --> check user is autheticated or not
      --> this is usefull whenever we refresh the application it checks whether the user is authenticated or not  
      --> depending on that we are takin them to profile page or login page


8. messages 
      --> getUsersforSidebar is used to show all the users in the side bar
      --> can get this by using/fetching loggedin userId 
      --> filter by means excluding current loggedIn userid

   * --> getMessages using by id
     --> adding filter to get messages btw two users
